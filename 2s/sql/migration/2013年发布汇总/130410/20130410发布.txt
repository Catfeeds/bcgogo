1. 将已退卡会员的status置为 DISABLED. (bcuser库)

update member set status = 'DISABLED'
where id in
(
	select invalid.id from
		(select m.id from member m inner join (select member_id from member_service group by member_id having max(times)=0 and min(times)=0) as ms
		 on m.id = ms.member_id
		 where m.balance = 0    -- 会员所有服务次数为0且余额为0
		UNION
		 select m.id from member m left join member_service ms on m.id = ms.member_id where ms.id is null and balance = 0   -- 会员没有服务且余额为0
		) as invalid
	inner join
		(select m.id from txn.member_card_return mcr left join member m on mcr.customer_id = m.customer_id) as returned     -- 退过卡的会员
	on invalid.id = returned.id
)

2. 后台重新索引 所有客户

3.添加资源，首页的车辆施工链接
vehicleConstruction WEB.VEHICLE_CONSTRUCTION.LINK render 车辆施工链接 shop
配到shop下那几个基本权限，哪个版本需要就配到哪个版本。要到生产上看下。
